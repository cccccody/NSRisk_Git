    "${\\bf In Defense of VaR}$: \n",
    "\n",
    "People like to criticize value at risk, and there has been a big push from certain quarters to favor expected shortfall (aka ES, conditional VaR, or cVaR) over VaR. I think this push is misguided (VaR is not as bad as they make it out to be and ES has its own shortcomings). \n",
    " \n",
    "For this article I wanted to look at how the ratio of ES over VaR changes over time. I suspect most practitioners expect this ratio to increase in stress environments (ES is supposed to tell us a lot about the shape of tails; we associate stress environments with tail risk; therefore ES should \"light up\" more in a stress environment than VaR). I wonder if the opposite is not true.\n",
    " \n",
    "To start, we could look at  realized VaR and ES for the S&P 500 in each calendar year from 1995 to present (you'd have at least three big market declines: tech bubble bursting in 1999, financial crisis in 2008, and current market). Depending on initial results, we could look at other indices (other countries, other asset classes) and/or hypothetical long/short portfolios.\n",

    "VaR to optimal VaR Ratio\n",
    "The most common way to backtest VaR models is to count the number of exceedances, which follow a binomial distribution. This test requires no assumptions (or no strong assumptions) and is very easy to compute. Unfortunately it is not very intuitive for non-quants.\n",
    " \n",
    "One alternative that we have been considering would answer the following question: by what constant would I have had to multiply my VaR forecasts to have exactly the right number of exceedances? For example, if my VaR forecast over the past year was too low, I would see too many exceedances, but if I had multiplied all of my forecasts by 1.23x I would have had exactly the right number. That 1.23x would be our\"VaR to optimal VaR ratio\".\n"
